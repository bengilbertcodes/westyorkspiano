### Testing

## Responsiveness

All pages were tested to ensure a responsive design was acheieved on screen sizes from 280px (Galaxy Fold) and upwards as defined in WCAG 2.2 Reflow Criteria (https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/#reflow).

Steps to test:

1. Open Chrome browser and naviagte to https://bengilbertcodes.github.io/westyorkspiano/.
2. Right click and se;ect Inspect to open developer tools.
3. Set to Responsive and reduce the width to 280px and set zoom to 50%.
4. Click and drag to repsonsive window up to max-width.

Expected results:

The site is responsive on all screen sizes, no images and iframes are stretched.
No horizontal scroll is present.
No elelments overlap.

Actual Results:
The webiste meets all responsiveness criteria.

The website has also been checked in Firefox, Safari, Chrome and Edge browsers and the following devices:
- Google Pixel 3a
- Ipad Pro
- Iphone 13

### Accessibility 

The Wave Accessibility (https://wave.webaim.org/) tool has been used throughout development and for the final testing of the website.

No errors were reported accross the site. 

Alerts:

- For redundant links where Home in the nav menu is next to the clickable page title. I am happy to leave this as is.
- Copyright text is very small. Due to this being just a copyright note I am happy to leave this.
- Embedded Youtube videos are present - Ensure that synchronized captioning is available. Two videos do not need captioning and two with a singer don't have them. This is something I need to consider for future recordings. 

### Lighthouse Testing

index.html:
![Lighthouse image for index.html](docs/readme_images/homepage-lighthouse.png)

lessons.html:
![Lighthouse image for lessons.html](docs/readme_images/lessons-lighthouse.png)

music.html
![Lighthouse image for music.html](docs/readme_images/music-lighthouse.png)

contact.html
![Lighthouse image for contact.html](docs/readme_images/contact-lighthouse.png)

All pages achieve score of 100 with the exception of music.html. This is due to the use of iframes for the videos and podcasts. As they are essentially a page within a page this greatly affects loading times. I will address this issue for future developments by reducing iframe use.

## Functional Testing

### Navigation Links

All navigation links across the site have been tested to ensure they guide the user to their respective pages. 

All social media links open in new pages.

### Form Testing

The form on contact.html hes been tested to ensure it functions as expected when data is enetered by the user, either correctly or incorrectly.

* If all fields are completed correctly by the user, when Send is clicked the user is presented with the thankyou.html page and then redirected back to home.html after 10 seconds of inactivity. 
* If Name: field is not completed then form will not submit and 'Please fill in this field' message is displayed.
* If Email: field is not completed then form will not submit and 'Please fill in this field' message is displayed.
* If Email: field is completed but data is not in email format (a@b.c) then the form will not submit and 'Please include an @ in the email address' message is displayed.
* If Mobile: field is incommplete then form will not submit and 'Please fill in this field' message is displayed.
* If Mobile: field is completed using anything another than a string of 11 digits then form will not submit and 'Please match the format' massage is displayed
* If Message: field is incomplete then form will not submit and 'Please fill in this field' message is displayed.

### Unfixed Bugs
There are no reported bugs to fix. 
Reducing use of Iframes recommeneded for future releases.
THe lessons-boxes don't adjust to different screen sizes at exactly the same time and at the time of writing this I haven't been able to correct this.
